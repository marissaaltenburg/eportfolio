    <p>Welcome to my e-portfolio, I am glad you are here!</p>

    <p>
        I’m a first-gen professional who found my path through higher education, and now I help others do the same. With 5+ years of experience in career services and ed tech, I design tools, trainings, and strategies that make career development more accessible, engaging, and impactful. I’m currently completing the UF Graduate Certification in Instructional Design, expected August 2026.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the University of Florida, I work in the Career Connections Center as a Career Data, Technology, and Engagement Strategist. I lead cross-campus projects that combine data, UX, and scalable technology to support students, alumni, and staff. Whether it’s launching a new platform, building a content strategy, or leading a team through change, I bring curiosity, creativity, and a deep belief in the power of education to change lives.
