    <p class="intro-highlight">Welcome to my e-portfolio!</p>

    <p>
        I’m a first-gen professional who found my path through higher education, and now I help others do the same. With 5+ years of experience in career services and ed tech, I design tools, trainings, and strategies that make career development more accessible, engaging, and impactful. I’m currently completing the UF Graduate Certification in Instructional Design, expected August 2026, to further strengthen my ability to create effective, learner-centered experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the University of Florida, I work in the Career Connections Center as a Career Data, Technology, and Engagement Strategist. I lead cross-campus projects that combine data, UX, and scalable technology to support students, alumni, and staff. Whether it’s launching a new platform, building a content strategy, or leading a team through change, I bring curiosity, creativity, and a deep belief in the power of education to change lives.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m passionate about designing user-friendly experiences, telling meaningful stories with data, making career development more accessible and inclusive, and building systems that help people thrive. If you’re into tech-powered learning, thoughtful strategy, and student success, we’ll get along great.
